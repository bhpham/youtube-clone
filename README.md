## Functional Requirements

- **List Videos**: Users can browse and view a curated list of uploaded videos.
- **User Authentication**: Sign-in and sign-out capabilities to manage user sessions.
- **Upload Videos**: Authenticated users can upload their videos.
- **Video Playback**: Users can watch videos uploaded by others.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Scalability**: The application is architected to handle a growing number of users and videos seamlessly.
- **Availability**: The system ensures high availability for an optimal user experience.

## Tech Stack

- **TypeScript**: For type safety and improved developer experience.
- **Next.js**: For building a performant and user-friendly frontend.
- **Express.js**: For backend API development.
- **Docker**: For containerization and easier deployment.
- **FFmpeg**: For handling video processing and transcoding.
- **Firebase Auth**: For secure user authentication.
- **Firebase Functions**: For serverless backend operations.
- **Firebase Firestore**: For real-time data storage and retrieval.
- **Google Cloud Storage**: For storing raw and processed video files.
- **Google Cloud Pub/Sub**: For handling messaging in video processing.
- **Google Cloud Run**: For hosting serverless applications.

## System Architecture

The architecture of the web application is designed to efficiently manage video uploads and processing. Key components include:

- **Cloud Storage**: Stores both raw and processed videos uploaded by users.
- **Pub/Sub**: Manages messaging to initiate video processing tasks.
- **Cloud Run**: Hosts a non-public service for video transcoding.
- **Cloud Firestore**: Maintains video metadata for easy retrieval.
- **Next.js App**: Serves as the client interface, interacting with Firebase Functions for data access.

## Design Architecture Flow

1. **Video Upload**: Users upload videos through the Next.js client.
2. **Message Queue**: A message is sent to Cloud Pub/Sub to initiate video processing.
3. **Transcoding**: The Cloud Run service processes the video using FFmpeg and uploads the output to Cloud Storage.
4. **Metadata Storage**: Video metadata is saved in Firestore for easy access.
5. **Video Retrieval**: The Next.js client requests video data from Firebase Functions for display and playback.
